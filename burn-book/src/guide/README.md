# Guide

This guide will go through the creation of a custom model built with Burn.
We will train the model on the MNIST dataset and prepare it for inference.

## Key Learnings

* How to create neural network models.
* How to train models on data.

All the code presented is actually available in the `guide` example.
For clarify, we sometimes omit imports.
